# GUI debug
To start GUI debugging, we first need to connect to the desktop display of the docker on our device. To do this, we need to use vnc. When we run the docker image following the instructions from [here](http://gados-doc.gadgethi.com.tw/03-Quick-start.html), the welcome message shows the url for connecting to the vnc desktop display. Using that url and access it from any browser on your host device, you are able to connect to the desktop display of the docker container. For example, if you are deploying this docker image on the Nvidia Jetson Nano, you will need to access this desktop display from the browser **in Nano**. In the future, we should bridge the ip and allow it to be access from any personal laptop in the local network. 

## Basic GUI debug commands
Here, I am going to introduce some basic GUI tools that we will use in ROS.

### Visualizing Images
To do this, simply use the ```rqt_image_view``` tool and select the corresponding topic to visualize the image you want. After a ROS master node, a launch file or ```roscore```, is launched, you can type the following command in the terminal:
```
rqt_image_view
```

### Visualizing All Topics, Images, and Transforms
There is a GUI tool in ROS called ```rviz``` which is used extensively to visualize all the topics, images, and transforms in a display. This is often use for robot localization, path planning, and many other applications. To use this tool, make sure a ROS master node is launched and type the following command in the terminal:
```
rviz
```
