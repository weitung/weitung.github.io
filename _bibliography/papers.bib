abstract = {This demo presents X-AR, an Augmented Reality headset that enables its user to find and retrieve hidden items. X-AR leverages battery-less 3-cent Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags that are already deployed on billions of items. As a user wearing X-AR moves in an environment, the headset transmits RF signals and leverages natural human mobility to locate RFID-tagged items. X-AR then guides the user toward the desired item for retrieval. We built a real-time prototype of this system on a Microsoft Hololens 2 AR headset with a conformal antenna, software radios, and an edge server. Our demo will enable any user to wear our X-AR prototype and use it to find and retrieve hidden items in a warehouse-like setting. Demo Video: youtu.be/bdUN21ft7G0},

abstract = {This demo presents SCOPE, an electric scooter equipped with RF sensing and License Plate Recognition (LPR) capabilities to achieve accurate and efficient parking enforcement. SCOPE leverages Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology and incorporates the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based RFID localization algorithm for precise parking spot recognition. Our demo presents an end-to-end system that combines License Plate Recognition (LPR) and RF-based positioning, achieving 88\% accuracy in matching vehicles to their lots and enabling automated parking enforcement in practical environments.
